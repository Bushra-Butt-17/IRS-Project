# 📚 **IRS Project - Information Retrieval System**  

Welcome to the **IRS Project**, a Python-based **Information Retrieval System** designed to efficiently process, retrieve, and analyze text data. This repository demonstrates multiple retrieval techniques with two distinct algorithms implemented in Jupyter notebooks for comparison.

---

## 🚀 **Features**  
- **Text Processing:** Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for data cleaning.  
- **Information Retrieval:** Extracts relevant text based on keywords or indexing methods.  
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Implements and compares two distinct algorithms for retrieval (IRS_A and IRS_B).  
- **Scalable Data Handling:** Works with multiple text files to simulate real-world retrieval tasks.

## 🗂️ **Project Structure**  

```
IRS/
├── check/
│   ├── f1.txt    # Sample text file 1
│   ├── f2.txt    # Sample text file 2
│   └── f3.txt    # Sample text file 3
├── IRS_A.ipynb    # Notebook for Algorithm 1
└── IRS_B.ipynb    # Notebook for Algorithm 2
```

### **File Breakdown**  
- **`check/`:** Contains sample text files for experimentation.  
- **`IRS_A.ipynb`:** Implements Algorithm 1, focusing on keyword matching and indexing.  
- **`IRS_B.ipynb`:** Explores Algorithm 2 with advanced retrieval techniques for comparison.

## 🛠️ **Getting Started**  

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bushra-Butt-17/IRS.git
   cd IRS
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment:**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Install required libraries using:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebooks:**  
   Open the project notebooks in Jupyter:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

---

## ✨ **Usage Examples**  
Here’s an example snippet from **`IRS_A.ipynb`**:

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Load and process text data
with open('check/f1.txt', 'r') as file:
    text_data = file.read()

# Example of basic tokenization
tokens = word_tokenize(text_data)
print("Tokens:", tokens)

# Retrieve relevant data
relevant_data = retrieve_data(tokens)
print("Relevant Data:", relevant_data)
```

You can modify the notebooks to experiment with different input files and retrieval techniques.
