# IRS Project üìö - Information Retrieval System

Welcome to the **IRS (Information Retrieval System)** project! This repository showcases an implementation of an Information Retrieval System designed to retrieve and analyze text-based data efficiently. It includes a variety of techniques to process and search through text data stored in text files. The project aims to demonstrate how different algorithms can be applied for text retrieval and comparison, offering insights into practical applications of information retrieval systems.

The system is built using Python and involves several key operations, including text processing, tokenization, indexing, and retrieval. Two different algorithms are explored in the notebooks provided (`IRS_A.ipynb` and `IRS_B.ipynb`) for comparison.

## Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

The repository has the following directory structure:

```
IRS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ check/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ f1.txt    # Sample text file 1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ f2.txt    # Sample text file 2
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ f3.txt    # Sample text file 3
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IRS_A.ipynb    # Jupyter Notebook A for experimentation or algorithm 1
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IRS_B.ipynb    # Jupyter Notebook B for experimentation or algorithm 2
```

### Breakdown of Files:

- **check/**: Contains text files used as input data for the IRS. The files (`f1.txt`, `f2.txt`, `f3.txt`) hold sample text that is processed for information retrieval operations.
  
- **IRS_A.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the first approach or algorithm for the Information Retrieval System. This notebook implements specific retrieval techniques, such as text indexing and retrieval based on keyword matching or other strategies.
  
- **IRS_B.ipynb**: A second Jupyter notebook that explores a different algorithm or approach for comparison. This allows for testing multiple strategies and comparing their performance.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bushra-Butt-17/IRS.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd IRS
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Python Environment**:
   Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If the file is not provided, you may need to manually install packages such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `nltk`, and `sklearn` for text processing and machine learning).

5. **Launch the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter notebooks (`IRS_A.ipynb` and `IRS_B.ipynb`) in your Jupyter environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Inside these notebooks, you will find code examples, explanations, and instructions for running the algorithms.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Text Processing**: Includes operations like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization to preprocess the text data.
  
- **Information Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant data from text files based on different algorithms. You can experiment with keyword-based retrieval, indexing, or other strategies.

- **Algorithm Comparison**: The project allows for the comparison of two different retrieval approaches (`IRS_A.ipynb` vs `IRS_B.ipynb`), helping to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods.

## Usage Examples üíª

Here‚Äôs a sample snippet from `IRS_A.ipynb` that demonstrates how the text files are processed:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data loading from f1.txt
with open('check/f1.txt', 'r') as file:
    text_data = file.read()

# Perform basic text processing (example)
processed_data = text_processing(text_data)

# Example of retrieving relevant information from the processed data
relevant_info = retrieve_data(processed_data)
print("Relevant Information:", relevant_info)
```

You can modify the code inside the notebooks to test with different text files or to adjust the retrieval parameters as needed.
